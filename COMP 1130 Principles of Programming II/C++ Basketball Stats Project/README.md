# Basketball Stats Displayer
This program calculates and displays basketball statistics for a team. It reads player data from a file, processes the data to compute various statistics such as points per game, assists, and rebounds, and then outputs the results in a formatted manner.

-Displays the players' names and stats to the console formatted <br>
-Let's the user choose who's stats that they would like to see <br>
## How to Use
1. Download prog6.cpp <br>
2. Create or use the example text file [Hoops.txt](https://github.com/Alexander-B47/Coding-Projects/blob/main/COMP%201130%20Principles%20of%20Programming%20II/C%2B%2B%20Basketball%20Stats%20Project/hoops.txt) <br>
3. Put your text file of basketball players and prog6.cpp in the same directory <br>
4. Use your C++ debugger and compiler of your choice and run it. <br>
## Details
prog6.cpp uses most of what I learned from this class; including: structs, reading from files, formatting, loops, decision structures, user input, etc.
