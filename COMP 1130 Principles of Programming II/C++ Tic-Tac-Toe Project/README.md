This was my first big project in this class. This project was also my first C++ project.
The purpose of this class is to allow the user to play a game of tic-tac-toe against another player using the same computer. 
Note: I had not envisioned at the time that an user would enter invalid moves outside the range, but it does check for over-writing previous moves.
Note 2: It is called prog2.cpp because we had skipped project 1 and did the second one as the first.
